## Giphy Beta API Notes
The API does not require you to create your own API key. There's a public beta API key available for everyone: `dc6zaTOxFJmzC`, and it must be included in each request URL.

**CORS** is supported.

See the [official documentation](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI) topics for:

- [viewing a gif by its ID](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#get-gif-by-id-endpoint) (details)
